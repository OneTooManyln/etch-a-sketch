# etch-a-sketch

BEFORE PROJECT//
In this second project of the JavaScipt Basics section, I will create a sketchpad using my DOM manipulation skills rather than creating it inside html alone. This project should not be easy for me and should require me to search for the correct JavaScipt methods and CSS to use.
